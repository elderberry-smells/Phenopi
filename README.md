# Phenopi
Timelapse and (future) phenotyping of plant images utilizing raspberry pi cameras and Flask for UX

This is version 0 of the app.  It...work...but there are some janks janking around in here that need to be un-janked.  Currently, its a nice interface that you can push a CRON job (timelapse and transfer of images to controller) to multiple raspberry pis.  

To come:

- full readme including how to install
- added functionality like Utilizing PlantCV directly in Flask app, setting up experiment parameters ahead of time
- fix the slideshow for pictures taken
- addition of greenhouse temps/light outputs.
- restructure of the project files so everything is organized into a nice and neat package
